FR:  ACTH and cortisol feed back negatively upon the hypothalamus to decrease the release of CRH back towards normal.  The cortisol also feeds back upon the anterior pituitary.  This, along with the reduction in CRH leads to less ACTH release.  The reduced ACTH leads to less cortisol release.<br /><br />
SS:  The negative feedback decreases the release of all three hormones but the levels never get back to normal.  Therefore the levels of all three hormone levels are still high, just not as high as you would have expected minus the feedback response.
